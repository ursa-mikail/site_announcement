3. For agent guided learning, let's also check by
3.1. Get 1 agent to create a process of chain of thought
3.2. Get another agent to check if the chain of thought is `adhering` (different phrasing, but equivalent meaning)
3.3. Question: how do we verify? As a small start, we have to check manually and push up the confidence as we monitoring along and start to delegate the trust by means of confidence?
* to be refined.

4. When [3] is possible, create thought profiling IM (Imitation Machines). The objective is to be able to imitate the thought process of a certain people as the thought process had been provided as template scaffolds. 

“”” pipeline: 
Train * → validate ** → _ compliance audit plugins (+ metric triggers)  → deploy *** → inference (context awareness and updates / upgrades) → monitor 
* register model and data
** register test packages
*** load model

The output of perception is recognition and identification - it is the input to decision.

1. Use DeepSeek to create test tooling to pass the NIST tests. Ask DeepSeek how many iteration to create each code parts. 
1.1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/usnistgov/ACVP-Server/master/gen-val/json-files/ACVP-AES-GCM-1.0/internalProjection.json
1.2. https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP-Server/tree/master/gen-val/json-files

2. Get DeepSeek to do mergekit on the models that are not combined yet, and see if it can beat at least the 3rd position model.
