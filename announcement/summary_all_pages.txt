4. **a04: Get Your YouTube Embed with Current Time Link**
   - In this part, users can embed a YouTube video and generate a link that includes the current playback time. Users can input a YouTube video URL, load the video, and copy a link that directs to the specific time. This section also includes a ciphered link feature with a tool to decipher Base64 encoded links.

5. **a05: Duration Calculator and YAML Generator**
   - The Duration Calculator and YAML Generator is a simple web application designed to help users calculate the duration between two dates and generate a YAML configuration based on the input data. The tool allows users to input their name, a list of tasks, and start and end dates. It then calculates the number of days between the start and end dates and formats the information into a YAML format.

6. **a06: Decipher Announcement / Cipher Text**
   - Provide a tool to decipher a ciphered announcement file and cipher plain text. 

7. **a07: I Ching Simulator**
   - Create a simulator for I Ching, explicitly stating that it has no connection to divinity or supernatural elements. The purpose of the I Ching simulator is to provide cues when people run out of ideas or wit, using the ancient Chinese text's wisdom and philosophy in a practical, secular manner.

8. **a08: Autocompete dictionary**
   - Find your words here.

9. **a09: Get Your YouTube Embed with Time Link (Curtailed Start and End)**
   - This web tool allows users to generate a YouTube embed link with specific start and end times. Users can either load a video by providing a standard YouTube URL or by entering a custom embed URL with defined start and end times.

10. **a10: Generates a random series of keyboard characters distribution trying to be uniform**
   - Generates a random series of keyboard characters, appends them to a display, and plots a histogram of the character distribution. It will notify the user when the distribution is uniform.

11. **a11: Claim Verification Registry**
   - This tool computes SHA-256 hashes for input texts with appended random hex values and checks if the computed hash exists in a verification file, displaying the corresponding line if found in the record.

12. **a12: File Cipher/Decipher**
   - This tool allows users to upload a file, cipher it with a provided or randomly generated AES key, and download the ciphered file as a12.ciphered.html. In another section, users can input an AES key to decipher the a12.ciphered.html file. If the key is correct, the decrypted announcement is displayed in an iframe within the page; otherwise, it announces an unauthorized attempt.

13. **a13: Distance Between Apples**
   - The provided code allows users to interactively move two red apple images on a map, displaying their coordinates and the distance between them in real time. As the apples are dragged, a line is drawn between them, with the distance shown both along the line and in the top-left corner. This solution offers a dynamic, visual way to measure and display the Euclidean distance between two draggable objects, with updates as the apples are repositioned.

14. **a14: Online Mnemonic Key Generator**
   - The online mnemonic key generator allows users to create and derive cryptographic keys based on a mnemonic phrase, which is a series of words commonly used for securely storing private keys. Users can input their own mnemonic words or generate a random set of words, and they are prompted to enter a password. The generator then uses the PBKDF2 key derivation function with SHA-256 to derive a secure key, ensuring the process is consistent with best practices in cryptography. The derived key, displayed in hexadecimal format, can be used for secure applications such as wallets or encryption systems.

15. **a15: Key Pair Generator**
   - Key pair generator with options for RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA algorithms. It includes functionality for generating and exporting cryptographic key pairs, as well as generating test vectors with random bytes and signatures. The unit test section allows users to generate random bytes, create signatures using the private key, and verify the signatures with the public key, displaying results in real-time. Additionally, users can download or copy the generated test vectors. The unit test section is visually separated by 2 horizontal lines, and its functionality is placed before the test vectors mass generation section.

16. **a16: RSA/ECDSA Key Management and Signing**
   - Outlines a comprehensive tool for handling AES encryption and signing using ECDSA keys. Users can input their ECDSA private key in hexadecimal format, which is then encrypted using a randomly generated AES key. This AES key and the encrypted private key are displayed to the user, with options to copy to the clipboard or download. Additionally, users can load an encrypted private key file and input an AES key to decrypt it. The system verifies the correctness of the AES key by attempting to sign a message and verifying it with the public key. If successful, a timestamp is appended to the message in the format YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm_ss, and the user can input a text message to be signed. The signed message can also be copied to the clipboard or downloaded as a permit.signed.txt file. 

17. **Web-Based Hex Key Derivation Tool**
   - This web-based tool allows users to input an initial hex key and specify a desired key length to generate a derived key using the PBKDF2 key derivation function with HMAC-SHA256. The tool provides an intuitive interface with input fields for the hex key and key length, a button to generate the derived key, and a feature to copy the derived key to the clipboard for convenience. Implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it utilizes the Web Crypto API for secure key derivation and conversion between hex strings and byte arrays.

Summary. **ax_summary: Summary of All Pages**
   - The ax_summary provides an overarching overview of all the sections (a1 to a4). It synthesizes the key points and functionalities from each part, ensuring that users have a clear understanding of the tools and resources available across the different functionalities.
