16. **a16: RSA/ECDSA Key Management and Signing**
   - Outlines a comprehensive tool for handling AES encryption and signing using ECDSA keys. Users can input their ECDSA private key in hexadecimal format, which is then encrypted using a randomly generated AES key. This AES key and the encrypted private key are displayed to the user, with options to copy to the clipboard or download. Additionally, users can load an encrypted private key file and input an AES key to decrypt it. The system verifies the correctness of the AES key by attempting to sign a message and verifying it with the public key. If successful, a timestamp is appended to the message in the format YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm_ss, and the user can input a text message to be signed. The signed message can also be copied to the clipboard or downloaded as a permit.signed.txt file. 

17. **Web-Based Hex Key Derivation Tool**

Implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it utilizes the Web Crypto API for secure key derivation and conversion between hex strings and byte arrays.

18. **Periodic Table Word Generator**
   - The Periodic Table Word Generator is a web-based tool that converts a given word or statement into images of periodic table elements. Each letter of the input is mapped to its corresponding element symbol (e.g., "H" for Hydrogen, "O" for Oxygen). The tool handles multi-character element symbols by prioritizing two-letter element combinations (e.g., "He" for Helium) before individual letters. Special characters, including spaces, are displayed as text, and the conversion of letters to element images ensures an engaging visual representation of the input text. This interactive tool provides a fun way to explore the periodic table while generating a visually interesting word display.

19. **Website Playlist Manager**
