<h2><a name="details">Details</a></h2>

<p>
Each of the fields in the one-time pad request form is described below.
</p>

<h3><a name="output">Output</a></h3>

<h4><a name="NumberOfKeys">Number of keys</a></h4>

<p>
Enter the number of keys to generate.  If you generate more than fit in the results text box, you can use the scroll bar to view the additional lines.
</p>

<h4><a name="LineLength">Line length</a></h4>

<p>
Lines in the output will be limited to the given length (or contain
only one key if the line length is less than required for a single
key).  If the line length > width of the results box, you can use the horizontal scroll bar to view the rest of the line.  Enter <tt>0</tt> to force one key per line; this is handy when you're preparing a list of keys to be read by a computer program.
</p>

<h3><a name="format">Format</a></h3>

<h4><a name="KeyLength">Key length</a></h4>

<p>
Each key will contain this number of characters, not counting separators between groups.
</p>

<h4><a name="GroupLength">Group length</a></h4>

<p>
If a nonzero value is entered in this field, the key will be broken into groups of the given number of characters by separators.  Humans find it easier to read and remember sequences of characters when divided into groups of five or fewer characters.
</p>

<h3><a name="composition">Composition</a></h3>

<h4><a name="KeyText">Key text</a></h4>

<p>
This set of radio buttons lets you select the character set used in
the keys.  The alternatives are listed in order of increasing security.
</p>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>Numeric</b></dt>
<dd>Keys contain only the decimal digits &#8220;0&#8221; through &#8220;9&#8221;.
    <em>Least secure.</em></dd>

<dt><b>Word-like</b></dt>
<dd>Keys are composed of alphabetic characters which obey the
    digraph statistics of English text.  Such keys contain
    sequences of vowels and consonants familiar to speakers
    of Western languages, and are therefore usually easier to
    memorise but, for a given key length, are less secure than purely random letters.</dd>

<dt><b>Alphabetic</b></dt>
<dd>Keys consist of letters of the alphabet chosen at random. 
    Each character has an equal probability of being 1 of the 26 letters.</dd>

<dt><b>Gibberish</b></dt>
<dd>Keys use most of the printable ASCII character set, excluding
    only characters frequently used for quoting purposes.  This
    option provides the greatest security for a given key length,
    but most people find keys like this difficult to memorise or
    even transcribe from a printed pad.  If a human is in the loop,
    it's often better to use a longer alphabetic or word-like key.
    <em>Most secure.</em></dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="LetterCase">Letters</a></h4>

<p>
The case of letters in keys generated with Word-like, Alphabetic, and
Gibberish key text will be as chosen.  Most people find it easier to
read lower case letters than all capitals, but for some applications
(for example, where keys must be scanned optically by hardware that
only recognises capital letters), capitals are required.  Selecting
&#8220;Mixed&nbsp;case&#8221; creates keys with a mix of upper- and
lower-case letters; such keys are more secure than those with uniform
letter case, but do not pass the &#8220;telephone test&#8221;: you
can't read them across a (hopefully secure) voice link without having
to indicate whether each letter is or is not a capital.
</p>

<h4><a name="RandomSep">Random separators</a></h4>

<p>
When the <a href="#KeyLength">Key length</a> is longer than
a nonzero <a href="#GroupLength">Group length</a> specification,
the key is divided into sequences of the given group length
by separator characters.  By default, a hyphen, &#8220;<tt>-</tt>&#8221;, is used
to separate groups.  If you check this box, separators will be
chosen at random among punctuation marks generally acceptable
for applications such as passwords.  If you're generating passwords
for a computer system, random separators dramatically increase the difficulty of guessing passwords by exhaustive search.
</p>

<h4><a name="Signatures">Include signatures</a></h4>

<p>
When this box is checked, at the end of the list of keys, preceded by
a line beginning with ten dashes &#8220;<tt>-</tt>&#8221;, the sha256 signature of
each key is given, one per line, with signatures expressed as 32
hexadecimal digits.  Key signatures can be used to increase security
when keys are used to control access to computer systems or databases.
Instead of storing a copy of the keys, the computer stores their
signatures.  When the user enters a key, its signature is computed
with the same sha256 used to generate it initially, and the key
is accepted only if the signature matches.  Since discovering
a key which will generate a given signature is believed to be
computationally prohibitive, even if the list of signatures stored on
the computer is compromised, that information will not permit an intruder to deduce a valid key.
</p>

<p>
Signature calculation is a computationally intense process for which
JavaScript is not ideally suited; be patient while signatures are generated.
</p>

<p>
For signature-based validation to be secure, it is essential
the original keys be long enough to prohibit discovery of matching
signatures by exhaustive search.  Suppose, for example, one used
four digit numeric keys, as used for Personal Identification
Numbers (PINs) by many credit card systems.  Since only 10,000
different keys exist, one could simply compute the signatures of
every possible key from 0000 through 9999, permitting an attacker who
came into possession of the table of signatures to recover the
keys by a simple lookup process.  For maximum security, keys must
contain at least as much information as the 128 bit signatures
computed from them.  This implies a minimum key length (not counting
non-random separator characters) for the various key formats as
follows:
</p>

<table class="c" border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tbody><tr><th>Key Composition</th> <th>Minimum Characters</th></tr>
<tr><td>Numeric</td> <td class="c">39</td></tr>
<tr><td>Word-like</td> <td class="c">30</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alphabetic</td> <td class="c">28</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gibberish</td> <td class="c">20</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Note: For many practical applications there is no
need for anything approaching 128-bit security.  The guidelines above
apply only in the case where maximum protection in the event of
undetected compromise of key signatures occurs.  In many
cases, much shorter keys are acceptable, especially when it is assumed
that a compromise of the system's password or signature database would
be only part of a much more serious subversion of all resources on the system.
</p>

<h3><a name="Seed">Seed</a></h3>

<p>
The <em>seed</em> is the starting value which determines all
subsequent values in the pseudorandom sequence used to generate
the one-time pad.  Given the seed, the pad can be reproduced.  The
seed is a 31-bit number which can be derived from the date and
time at which the one-time pad was requested, or from a
user-defined seed value.  If the user-defined seed consists
entirely of decimal digits, it is used directly as the seed,
modulo 2<sup>31</sup>; if a string containing non-digit characters
is entered, it is used to compute a <em>hash code</em> which is
used to seed the generator.
</p>

<p>
When the clock is used to create the seed, the seed value is entered
in the User-defined box to allow you, by checking &#8220;User-defined&#8221;,
to produce additional pads with the same seed.
</p>

<h2><a name="security">Security</a></h2>
<p>
Even if some mechanism such as encryption could absolutely prevent the
pad's being intercepted, you'd still have no way to be sure the site generating the pad didn't keep a copy
in a file, conveniently tagged with your Internet address.
</p>

<p>
It is essential that the pad be generated on <em>trusted</em> computer (with trusted entropy), without
involving any transmission or interaction with other sites on the Internet.  It does not transmit anything over the Internet. 
</p>

<p>
1-time pad generated with this page might be compromised in a variety of ways, including the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>    Web browser and/or JavaScript interpreter may
        contain bugs or deliberate security violations
        which report activity on your computer back to some
        other Internet site.</li>

<li>    Some other applet running on another page of your
        browser, perhaps without your being aware of its
        existence, is spying on other windows.</li>

<li>    Some other application running on your computer
        may have compromised your system's security and
        be snooping on your activity.</li>

<li>    Web browser may be keeping a &#8220;history log&#8221;
        or &#8220;cache&#8221; of data you generate.  Somebody may
        come along later and recover a copy of the pad
        from that log.</li>

<li>    The implementation of this page may contain a bug
        or deliberate error which makes its output
        predictable.  This is why <a href="#trans"><cite>transparency</cite></a>,
        discussed below, is essential.</li>

<li>    Your computer's security may have been compromised
        physically; when's the last time you checked that a
        bug that transmits your keystrokes and/or screen
        contents to that van parked down the street
        wasn't lurking inside your computer cabinet?</li>
</ul>

<p>
1 way to rule out the most probable risks is to download a copy of the generator page and run it
from a &#8220;<tt>file:</tt>&#8221; URL on a computer which has no network
connection whatsoever and is located in a secure location
under your control.  And look  carefully at any files
created by your Web browser.  You may find things squirreled away there&#8230;.
</p>

<p>
<b><a name="trans">Transparency</a>.</b>
Any security-related tool is only as good as its design
and implementation.  <em>Transparency</em> means that, in
essence, all the moving parts are visible so you can judge
for yourself whether the tool merits your confidence.  In
the case of a program, this means that source code must
be available, and that you can verify that the program
you're running corresponds to the source code provided.
</p>

<p>
Transparency is important even if you don't know enough about
programming or security to determine whether the program
contains any flaws.  The very fact that it can be examined
by anybody allows those with the required expertise to pass
judgement, and you can form your own conclusions based on
their analysis.
