        <description>
            The online mnemonic key generator allows users to create and derive cryptographic keys based on a mnemonic phrase, which is a series of words commonly used for securely storing private keys. Users can input their own mnemonic words or generate a random set of words, and they are prompted to enter a password. The generator then uses the PBKDF2 key derivation function with SHA-256 to derive a secure key, ensuring the process is consistent with best practices in cryptography. The derived key, displayed in hexadecimal format, can be used for secure applications such as wallets or encryption systems.

        <description>
            Outlines a comprehensive tool for handling AES encryption and signing using ECDSA keys. Users can input their ECDSA private key in hexadecimal format, which is then encrypted using a randomly generated AES key. This AES key and the encrypted private key are displayed to the user, with options to copy to the clipboard or download. Additionally, users can load an encrypted private key file and input an AES key to decrypt it. The system verifies the correctness of the AES key by attempting to sign a message and verifying it with the public key. If successful, a timestamp is appended to the message in the format YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm_ss, and the user can input a text message to be signed. The signed message can also be copied to the clipboard or downloaded as a permit.signed.txt file.
