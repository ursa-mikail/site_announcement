        <title>14. Online Mnemonic Key Generator</title>
        <description>
            The online mnemonic key generator allows users to create and derive cryptographic keys based on a mnemonic phrase, which is a series of words commonly used for securely storing private keys. Users can input their own mnemonic words or generate a random set of words, and they are prompted to enter a password. The generator then uses the PBKDF2 key derivation function with SHA-256 to derive a secure key, ensuring the process is consistent with best practices in cryptography. The derived key, displayed in hexadecimal format, can be used for secure applications such as wallets or encryption systems.

            Key pair generator with options for RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA algorithms. It includes functionality for generating and exporting cryptographic key pairs, as well as generating test vectors with random bytes and signatures. The unit test section allows users to generate random bytes, create signatures using the private key, and verify the signatures with the public key, displaying results in real-time. Additionally, users can download or copy the generated test vectors. The unit test section is visually separated by 2 horizontal lines, and its functionality is placed before the test vectors mass generation section.

        <title>16. RSA/ECDSA Key Management and Signing</title>
        <description>
            Outlines a comprehensive tool for handling AES encryption and signing using ECDSA keys. Users can input their ECDSA private key in hexadecimal format, which is then encrypted using a randomly generated AES key. This AES key and the encrypted private key are displayed to the user, with options to copy to the clipboard or download. Additionally, users can load an encrypted private key file and input an AES key to decrypt it. The system verifies the correctness of the AES key by attempting to sign a message and verifying it with the public key. If successful, a timestamp is appended to the message in the format YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm_ss, and the user can input a text message to be signed. The signed message can also be copied to the clipboard or downloaded as a permit.signed.txt file.

        <description>
            This web-based tool allows users to input an initial hex key and specify a desired key length to generate a derived key using the PBKDF2 key derivation function with HMAC-SHA256. The tool provides an intuitive interface with input fields for the hex key and key length, a button to generate the derived key, and a feature to copy the derived key to the clipboard for convenience. Implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it utilizes the Web Crypto API for secure key derivation and conversion between hex strings and byte arrays.

        <title>18. Periodic Table Word Generator</title>
        <description>
            The Periodic Table Word Generator is an interactive web tool that converts a given input text into images of elements from the periodic table. Each letter in the word or phrase is mapped to the corresponding element's symbol (e.g., "H" for Hydrogen). For two-letter element symbols (e.g., "He" for Helium), the tool prioritizes combining two characters into an element symbol first, ensuring accurate matching. Special characters like spaces and punctuation remain as text. This tool provides an engaging and educational way to visualize text while learning about the elements of the periodic table.
